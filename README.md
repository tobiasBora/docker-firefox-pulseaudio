# Dockerized Spotify

Run Firefox inside an isolated [Docker](http://www.docker.io) container. This is achieved by sharing a socket for X11 and PulseAudio. This code is based on the terlar code for spotify [docker-spotify-pulseaudio](https://github.com/terlar/docker-spotify-pulseaudio). This version does not get/save the configuration of firefox in the user home, everything stay inside the docker container.

  sudo docker build -t firefox .
  ```

3. Run the provided spotify script:

If you get an error about impossible display, and if you run Fedora or any other distribution using SELinux, you may want to try to temporary disable SELinux by using:

   sudo setenforce 0
   ```
